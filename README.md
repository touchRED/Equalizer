#Equalizer
---

An **HTML5** project by Connor Trotter

This is basically an interactive equalizer sort of thing, hence the name. Its definitely a work in progress right now, but in the future I plan to add different keys and/or instruments. 

Also, Equalizer works using the [Audiolet](https:github.com/oampo/Audiolet) library. Be sure to check that out as well.

See you soon!
